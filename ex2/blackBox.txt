1: Specify the input space for each argument to the method (including the object of that method).
    a) Requires: nemplyee, starttime and endtime are integers >= 0
       Ensures that:
            if starttime > endtime:
                work schedule remains unchanged.
            if starttime < endtime and nemployee < workingemployee
                required number of employees becomes nemployees and the correct number of excess employees are removed
            if startime < endtime and nemployee >= workingemployee

    b) Requires: currenttime >= 0 and currenttime < size

       Ensures that:

2: Divide this input space/partition into blocks, based on the specification.
    a)  Block #1: starttime > endtime
        test_setRequiredNumber_part1: input: "startime = 4", "endtime = 2", expected: "setRequiredNumber(nemployee, starttime, endtime) = workSchedule"

        Block #2: starttime <= endtime and nemployee < workingemployees.length

        Block #3 startime <= endtime and nemployee >= workingemployees.length

    b)  Block #1: Hour not completed: workingemployees.length < requiredNumber
        Block #2: hour completed: workingemployees.length >= requiredNumber on that hour, but hour later is incompleted
        Block #3: hour completed: workingemployees.length >= requiredNumber on that hour

3: Implement at least one test case for each block, and possibly additional border cases.
    a)
        Test Block #1:
    Input: nemployee = 3, starttime = 5, endtime = 2
    Expected: no hour is changed.

        Test Block #2:
    Setup: hour 3 har arbetslista ["A", "B", "C"] --> workingemployees.length = 3.
    Input: nemployee = 2, starttime = 3, endtime = 3
    Expected:
    requiredNumber(3) = 2
    workingEmployees(3) = ["A", "B"]

        Test Block #3:
    Setup: hour 2 har arbetslista ["A", "B"]
    Input: nemployee = 5, starttime = 2, endtime = 2
    Expected:
    requiredNumber(2) = 5
    workingEmployees(2) unchanged

    b)
        Test Block #1:
    Setup: hour 3 har requiredNumber[3] = 2 och arbetslista ["A"]
    Input: currenttime = 3
    Expected: returns 3

        Test Block #2:
    Setup:
    hour 2 complete, workingemployees.length >= requirdNumber(2)
    hour 3 complete, workingemployees.length >= requirdNumber(3)
    hour 4 incomplete, workingemployees.length < requirdNumber(4).
    Input: currenttime = 2
    Expected: returns 4

        Test Block #3:
    Setup: all hours have workingEmployees.length >= requiredNumber
    Input: currenttime = 0
    Expected: returns -1

4: For each test case, give a comment that describes which block it tests.

a) setRequiredNumber

  public void setRequiredNumber(int nemployee, int starttime, int endtime) { ... }

requires:
  0 <= nemployee and  0 <= starttime and  0 <=endtime
ensures:
  if starttime > endtime then
    the schedule is unchanged
  otherwise
      for each Hour between starttime and endtime (inclusive)
          if the length of workingEmployees is greater than nemployee
          then
             requiredNumber is set to nemployee and workingEmployees
             keeps a number of employees equal to nemployee, discarding
             the rest
          otherwise
             requiredNumber is set to nemployee and workingEmployees is unchanged
      and the rest of the schedule is unchanged
